# clean-up-google
google is muddled up with a bunch of unnecessary stuff; how about we give you the option to remove it? 

features:
- ai overview block
- cleaned up navbar
- turn on/off personalization at the top (where it belongs)
- preview on hover of websites
- analysis on the bias of the websites (coming up)
