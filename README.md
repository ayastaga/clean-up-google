# CleanUP!
google is muddled up with a bunch of unnecessary stuff; how about we give you the option to remove it? 

features:
- ai overview block
- cleaned up navbar
- remove sponsored results
- preview on hover of websites (so you know what you're getting into)

## How to set up
1. Download the files as a folder
2. Go to chrome://extensions 
3. Turn **Developer Mode** ON
4. Click **Load Unpacked** and upload the folder
5. Boom the extension is up and running
